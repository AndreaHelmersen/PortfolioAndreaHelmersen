    "During the summer of 2023, I worked at Experis, with further improving Dissimilis' color notation app. Dissimilis have developed a color-based music notation system for children facing various challenges. Our 12-member team (comprising 3 designers and 9 developers) had a primary focus of doubeling the user base and enhance user-friendliness. We introduced features such as group functions, playlists, admin user management, song favoriting, filtering of songs, and editable information pages.\n\nWe were entrusted with significant responsibility for the project, which i think further motivated us to work hard and to it well, following agile principles with one-week sprints. I worked on both frontend (React + TypeScript) and backend (ASP.NET in C# with Entity Framework). This dual-role helped me understand the entire feature implementation process. \n\nWorking with this exceptional team was a highlight; everyone got along great and teamwork was seamless. We also enjoyed many social afterwork-nights with 'fussball' tournaments and other activities. This job was a valuable learning opportunity, as it was my first chance to develop something used by others and it's an experience I'll carry forward.",

It's now hosted using GitHub Pages, and here you are :) . I had never depolyed something to be hosted before and I think that was a very good learning experience. The reason i wanted to create a website using React was that it is now much easier to add to my portfolio than it was before.",
